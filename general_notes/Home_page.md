* The problem:
  * Every year around 160.000 bikes are turned into scrap
  * Another 150.000 are neglected
  * These bikes usually need minor repairs, but we are not willing to do that.
* What we need: We need to change how we see and value our bikes.
* How does UpKeep work?
  * You find a local workshop that is part of the UpKeep Community
  * Here you can make your own bicycle parts and get help with repairs if you need it.
  * You can make your bike nicer to look at, more functional and more unique
  * In the end we hope that you will keep using your bike for a bit longer.
* These are the parts that you can make yourself!
  * Visual of bicycle with all the highlighted parts that you can make yourself.
* Come and make a part for yourself or start a workshop, and join the community of bikers who care.
