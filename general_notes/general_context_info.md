I'm making a website. Its for my opensource community that needs to encourage people to repair their own bikes with DIY. I want to create awareness with this website and show that there is another way to take care of your bikes. It is called UpKeep bicycles and i included the logo. Do you have ideas for the visual style of the website that would fit and maybe have examples of existing websites?

The concept is not to share repair instructions, but rather to have open source plans for bicycle parts: saddle, handlebars, chain guard, fender, lights, pedals, rack. These parts have the biggest influence on feeling of degradation and are not too technical to make yourself. Normally these parts are not maintained, because the bicycle works without them, but once the bike really breaks down (flat tire, or broken chain for example) these other parts have emotionally and technically made the bike worthless. That is why we should fix parts while they the rest of the bike is still working.
